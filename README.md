# system-commander
Programs and scripts that perform useful actions on a system (usually Linux). Some might require admin/root access on the system

For the most efficient usage, add the dir `/path/to/system-commander/run/` to your environment PATH
> The objects in `run` are symbolic links to the running programs in their respective directories. If you want to add it you can do it manually or run the bash script `add_path.sh` in the `run` directory
